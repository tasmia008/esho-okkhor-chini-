<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on recognizing Bangla handwritten characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters, and various techniques are used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is utilized to interpret the model’s predictions.</p>


<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset for this project is stored on Google Drive and includes images of Bangla handwritten characters. The dataset is downloaded and unzipped as part of the preprocessing steps.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The trained model achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing Bangla handwritten characters. The use of LIME provided valuable insights into the model’s decision-making process, highlighting the areas of the image that contributed most to the predictions.</p>
