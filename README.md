Overview
This project focuses on recognizing Bangla handwritten characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of handwritten characters, and various techniques are used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is utilized to interpret the model’s predictions.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing
CNN model implementation and training
Model evaluation and testing
Interpretability of model predictions using LIME
Dataset
The dataset for this project is stored on Google Drive and includes images of Bangla handwritten characters. The dataset is downloaded and unzipped as part of the preprocessing steps.
